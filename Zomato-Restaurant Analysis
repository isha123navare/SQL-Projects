1. Descriptive Analysis
a. Calculate the total number of restaurants by city or locality.

Query:
a)	For City 

SELECT 
    "City", 
    COUNT(DISTINCT "Restaurant ID") AS total_restaurants
FROM 
    zomato
GROUP BY 
    "City"
ORDER BY 
    total_restaurants DESC;

b) For Locality

SELECT 
    "Locality", 
    COUNT(DISTINCT "Restaurant ID") AS total_restaurants
FROM 
    zomato
GROUP BY 
    "Locality"
ORDER BY 
    total_restaurants DESC;


b. Find the average rating of restaurants by city or locality.

a) For City

SELECT 
    "City", 
    AVG("Aggregate rating") AS avg_rating
FROM 
    zomato
GROUP BY 
    "City"
ORDER BY 
    avg_rating DESC;

b) For Locality

SELECT 
    "Locality", 
    AVG("Aggregate rating") AS avg_rating
FROM 
    zomato
GROUP BY 
    "Locality"
ORDER BY 
    avg_rating DESC;

c)	Calculate the count of cuisines and analyze most popular cuisines

SELECT 
    unnest(string_to_array("Cuisines", ', ')) AS cuisine,
    COUNT(*) AS cuisine_count
FROM 
    "zomato"
GROUP BY 
    cuisine
ORDER BY 
    cuisine_count DESC;


2. Comparative Analysis
a) Compare the average cost for two across different cities.

SELECT 
    "City", 
    "Locality", 
    AVG("Average Cost for two") AS average_cost_for_two
FROM 
    "zomato"
GROUP BY 
    "City", "Locality"
ORDER BY 
    average_cost_for_two DESC;

b) Compare the average votes received by restaurants offering different cuisines.
Since the cuisines are present in a single row, separated by commas, there is a need to use the UNNEST() function to split the cuisines:

SELECT 
    cuisine,
    AVG("Votes") AS average_votes
FROM (
    SELECT 
        unnest(string_to_array("Cuisines", ', ')) AS cuisine,
        "Votes"
    FROM 
        "zomato"
) AS cuisine_data
GROUP BY 
    cuisine
ORDER BY 
    average_votes DESC;

3. Aggregation and Grouping
a) Group restaurants by Price range and find the average aggregate rating for each range.

SELECT 
    "Price range", 
	AVG("Aggregate rating") as avg_aggregate_rating
FROM 
    "zomato"
GROUP BY 
    "Price range"
ORDER BY 
     avg_aggregate_rating DESC,"Price range" DESC;

b) Group by City to find the total votes and average votes.

4. Filtering and Segmentation
a) Identify the top-rated restaurants (e.g., Aggregate rating > 4.5).
b) Filter for restaurants that have table booking but no online delivery.
c) Find restaurants with the most votes in each city.

5. Trend Analysis
a) Analyze the relationship between price range and aggregate ratings.
b) Study how Average Cost for Two affects the number of votes.

6. Geographical Insights
a) Identify restaurants with the highest rating within a specific Longitude and Latitude range.
b) Determine which cities/localities have the most number of restaurants.

7. Customer Preferences
a) Analyze the most popular cuisines based on votes and aggregate ratings.
b) Find out which price range receives the highest votes.

8. Outlier Detection
a) Detect restaurants with unusually high or low average costs.
b) Identify restaurants with a significantly higher number of votes compared to the average.

9. Textual Insights
a) Identify the most common cuisines offered across restaurants in a city.
b) Analyze Rating text distribution (e.g., "Excellent," "Very Good") by cuisine or city.
